The settings supported by the app are documented in then `CONFIGURATION.md` file. 

This file is automatically generated from `app/settings.py`. It can be updated by running:

```
. update_docs.sh
```

If you want to print the settings to stdout, you can run:

```
python scripts/show_env_vars.py [--no-color]
```

### Run tests

To run regular tests:

```
. run_tests.sh [OPTIONS]
```

To run a specific test

```
. run_tests.sh tests/path/to/file_test.py
```

To run doctests:

```
. run_doctests.sh [OPTIONS]
```

Both scripts accept options, see their files for more info.

. console.sh
```

## Other notes

This service always uses host 0.0.0.0 and port 80, assumes that it will be run inside a container and that the ports
will be forwared to other values.
